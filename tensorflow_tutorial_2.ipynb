    "Scikit Learn offers a simple API to do machine learning, specially in comparison to TensorFlow. The main problem with scikit learn is that most of the models are shallow ones (e.g. Logistic Regression, SVM, etc). The `MLPClassifier` exists and offers the possibility for a Neural Network classifier, however it is considerably slow to train a classifier and doesn't provide GPU optimization. The [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html) itself says the implementation of `MLPClassifier` is not intended for large-scale applications.\n",
